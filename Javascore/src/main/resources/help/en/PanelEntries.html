<h3><b>JavaScore - Entries Screen</b></h3>
<p>This panel edits information about entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The window has two
main components.&nbsp; On the left is a &quot;tree&quot; of all entries by
class.&nbsp; On the right is the details about the selected entry (if
any).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open a class in the tree and show its entries, click on the toggle (<img border="0" src="PanelE1.gif" width="17" height="10">)
so that it looks like this (<img border="0" src="PanelE2.gif" align="bottom" width="15" height="20">).&nbsp;
When you click on an entry in the tree, its details will be show on the right.</p>
<p>Press Add to add a new entry (select a class first, and that class will be
the new entry's initial division).</p>
<p>Select one or more entries, and press Delete to delete entries.</p>
<p>In the Entry Panel itself, the following data is
currently maintained about each entry.&nbsp; All of this information is
optional, but I strongly suggest that you give each boat at least a&nbsp; sail
number, and either a boat name or a skipper's name.&nbsp; The rest is up to
you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="division"></a><b>Class</b>:&nbsp; this choice box tells the class in
which the boat is entered.&nbsp; You set the classes in the event on the <a href="PanelRegatta.html">main
regatta screen</a>.&nbsp; By default, the selected class for a new entry is the
same class as the previous entry.&nbsp; If you have only one class, leaving
class of &quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot; is OK (but ugly, I wouldn't do it if I were
you, but I recognize that often single class imports may not have a class
assigned).&nbsp; If you have more than one class in the event, boats without a
class assignment will not be scored.</p>
<p><a name="rating"></a><b>Rating</b>: This only shows when the class is a handicap class, enter the
boat's rating</p>
<p><a name="sail"></a><b>Sail#</b>: the sail number of the boat.&nbsp; This can
be anything you'd like.&nbsp; I will parse into into 3 pieces: an initial
alphabetic portion, a center number, and a trailing alphabetic portion.&nbsp;
None of the three are required, but they correspond to the typical sailing
number:&nbsp; Country Number {trailer}.&nbsp; The 'trailer' is not often used,
but countries like England sometimes have numbers like:&nbsp; &quot;GBR 2345
Y&quot;.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Duplicates are accepted, although I will warn you if you
enter a duplicate.</p>
<p><a name="bow"></a><b>Bow#:</b> the bow number of the boat.&nbsp; This field
only appears if the &quot;Bow numbers&quot; parameter is selected on the main
regatta page.&nbsp; Like the Sail#, this does not have to be a number, I accept
any string.&nbsp; I also will accept duplicates, but will warn you first. </p>
<p>A warning will be generated for Bow numbers that match Sail numbers and vica
versa.</p>
<p><a name="name"></a><b>Name:</b>&nbsp; The boat's name (If there is one, blank
is fine).</p>
<p><a name="team"></a><b>Team Table</b>: In each row, enter the last name, first name
and the isaf id (if any) of the skipper and crew. If it is a syndicate name, I recommend putting the entire name as
the last name rather than part of it as the first name.  You can enter as many crew as you want, just
keep putting new crew names in the "*" row and a new row for the next crew member will be appear.</p>
<p>If you enter a sailor's
ISAF sailor id, then I'll automatically create a link around the sailor's name in all the reports to point to
their biographical information on the ISAF web site (www.sailing.org).&nbsp; For
more information about this free service from ISAF, see: <a href="http://www.sailing.org/isafsailor/">http://www.sailing.org/isafsailor/</a>. </p>
<p><a name="rsa"></a><b>&quot;CBYRA#&quot; or &quot;Rsa&quot;</b> or something
else:&nbsp; This is the field for the &quot;Regional Sailing Association
membership number.&nbsp; I'm vague about the specific text you might see, but
the end-user can set the label for this field.&nbsp; See below.&nbsp; By
default, I ship with it set to &quot;CBYRA&quot; (for Chesapeake Bay Yacht
Racing Association), that's only because that's where the author is from.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can change this label in the Preferences panel. </p>
<p><a name="mna"></a> <b>&quot;US Sailing#&quot; or &quot;Mna&quot;</b> or
something else.&nbsp; This is where the entry's membership number for their
Member National Authority should be entered.&nbsp; Likewise, the user can set
the label for this, I ship with it set to &quot;US Sailing&quot;. You can change
this label in the Preferences panel.</p>
<p><a name="club"></a><b>Club:</b> This should be the home club for the entry</p>
<p><b><a name="subdivision"></a>SubDivisions:</b> This panel only appears when
you have defined one or more sub-divisions within the regatta.&nbsp; If it
appears, then check each sub-division in which the entry ought to be a part.</p>
