<h3>Java Score - SubDivision Screen</h3>
<p>This panel edits information about the subdivisions participating in a
regatta.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> A subdivision is a subset of a Starting
Divisions.&nbsp; Members of a sub-division race with their parent starting
division and a scored as part of both the starting division and as part of the
subdivisions.&nbsp;&nbsp; An example of a sub-division might be scoring Juniors
within a larger Open Division.</p>
<p>See also the <a href="GeneralIntro.html">General Intro</a> page for more
information on using Fleets and SubDivisions.</p>
<p>This screen as two main areas.&nbsp; On the left are the names of all
subdivisions in this regatta.&nbsp; On the right, the details of a selected
subdivision.&nbsp; Press Add to add a new subdivision.&nbsp; Select one or more races, and press Delete to delete a
subdivision.</p>
<p>Within a subdivision, you currently have the following fields to set:</p>
<p><a name="name"></a><b>SubDivision</b> <b>Name</b>: name of the class.&nbsp; Anything you
like.&nbsp; This will be the name used on all reports for this subdivision.</p>
<p><b><a name="parentdiv"></a>Parent Division:</b>&nbsp; Select from the
drop-down list of all starting classes in the regatta, which class your
subdivsion members will come from.&nbsp; </p>


<p><b><a name="addon"></a>Race score points add-on:</b>&nbsp; Use this to "add-on" points for each race any
boat in this subdivision races in.  This is used mostly commonly for events like Laser Masters where the "Apprentice" master sailors
typically get 3 points added on, "Masters" get 2 points, "Grand Masters" get 1 point, and "Great Grand Masters get 0 points". NOTE that these 
add-ins are non-standard and must be well defined in the sailing instructions for the event!<br></p>

<p><b><a name="scoreseparately"></a>Score entrants separately from parent class:&nbsp; 
</b>Check 
this box if you want the members of the sub-division to be re-scored separately 
from their finish within their parent class.&nbsp; If for example, you have a 
sailor, Pat, in the Junior subdivision within the Open starting division.&nbsp; 
In race 1,&nbsp; Pat gets a 5th overall, but is the first Junior sailor to 
finish.&nbsp; Pat will get a 5th within the Open class.&nbsp; If&nbsp; Pat's 
score in the Junior subdivision should also be a 5th, leave this box 
unchecked.&nbsp; If Pat's should get a 1st in the Junior subdivision, then check 
this box.&nbsp; (<b>Strong suggestion:</b> Ensure that what you select is backed 
up by the sailing instructions)</p>
<p><b><a name="monopoly"></a>Can entrants belong to other subdivisions:&nbsp; </b>Check
this box if entries can be entered in more that one subdivision.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, subdivisions like Opti Blue, Green, and White,
there should be no overlap (a sailor cannot be both a Blue and a Green Opti
sailor at the same time).&nbsp; In this case, make sure this box is unchecked.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the subdivisions might be something like
&quot;Women&quot;,&quot;Senior&quot;,&quot;Junior&quot; within the overall
&quot;Open&quot; class.&nbsp; A young female sailor would be eligible for both
&quot;Women&quot; and &quot;Junior&quot; divisions.&nbsp; In these cases, make
sure this check box is selected. </p>
<p><a name="qual"></a><strong>Qualifying/Final/Medal/Scoring Group Type</strong>:&nbsp; If you are splitting 
the entries into qualifying groups then into Final groups.&nbsp; Click 
&quot;Qualifying&quot; if this subdivision is one of the qualifying sub-divisions, 
otherwise click final if its part of the final series sub-divisions.  If you further split your final series into a medal race, select Medal (You normally only do this for Sailing World Cup events or Olympic-style racing)</p>
<p>If the group is used for sub-group not related to 
  the qualifying final divisions, then select "Scoring" (eg the red/white/blue subidivison in the 
  Opti class, or the "Corinthian" division in the Melges class</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
