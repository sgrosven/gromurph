<h3>Java Score - Master Divisions Screen</h3>
<p>This panel edits information about all known classes or divisions.&nbsp; When
you create a regatta, you can select among this list of classes to determine
what classes are participating in the regatta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This screen as two main areas.&nbsp; On the left are the names of all known
classes.&nbsp; On the right, the details of a selected class</p>
<p>Press Add to add a new division</p>
<p>Select one or more races, and press Delete to delete a division.</p>
<p>Note that editing this information will affect only the master list of
classes, once a class has been entered into a regatta, its information is frozen
for that regatta.</p>
<p>The details about a class are:</p>
<p><a name="name"></a><b>Class Name</b>: name of the class.&nbsp; Anything you
like.&nbsp; Although be aware that if you import entries via the File | Import
menu, the name of the class in the import data must be an exact match on a class
in this list.</p>
<p><a name="Rating System"></a><b>Rating System: </b>the rating system to be
used with this class.&nbsp; Currently, Javascore supports one design, PHRF, MORC
(which is their newer seconds/mile basis), and the Chesapeake Bay's Multihull
formula (which is a pretty straight forward Time-on-Time formula).</p>
<p><a name="1dclassname"><b></b></a><b>1D Class Name: (for one design classes
only)</b>&nbsp; The name of the one design class.&nbsp; Most of the time this
will be the same as the Class Name.&nbsp; However, you might have for example a
large Laser regatta in which you have Laser Masters, Laser Youths, and Laser
Open.&nbsp; In that case, your class name in the upper field might be
&quot;Masters&quot;, &quot;Youths&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;, which the 1D Class
Name for all classes would be &quot;Laser&quot;. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This field is a &quot;combo box&quot; if you see the class
you want in the list, go ahead a select it, if not, just type in the name of the
class you do want</p>
<p><b><a name="fastestrating"></a>Fastest Rating: (Handicap classes only) </b>The
fastest allowed rating in this division. </p>
<p><b><a name="slowestrating"></a>Slowest Rating: (Handicap classes only) </b>The
slowest allowed rating in this division. </p>
<p>When you press OK to close this dialog, the master division information is
automatically saved.</p>
