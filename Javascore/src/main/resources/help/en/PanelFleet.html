<h3>Java Score - Fleets Screen</h3>
<p>This panel edits information about the fleets participating in a
regatta.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> A fleet is a combination of several Starting
Divisions.&nbsp; All members of each Starting Division in a Fleet are combined
into the fleet for &quot;overall&quot; scoring.&nbsp; Some examples of fleets
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Several individual PHRF classes could be combined into an overall PHRF
    fleet.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A large one-design regatta could be split into several &quot;qualifying
    groups&quot; which race in various combinations.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p>See also the <a href="GeneralIntro.html">General Intro</a> page for more
information on using Fleets and SubDivisions.</p>
<p>This screen as two main areas.&nbsp; On the left are the names of all fleets
in this regatta.&nbsp; On the right, the details of a selected fleet.&nbsp; Press Add to add a new
fleet.&nbsp; Select one or more races, and press Delete to delete a division.</p>
<p>Within a fleet, you currently have the following fields to set:</p>
<p><a name="name"></a><b>Fleet Name</b>: name of the class.&nbsp; Anything you
like.&nbsp; This will be the name used on all reports for this fleet.</p>
<p><b><a name="divs"></a>Starting Divisions:</b>&nbsp; There should be a check
box for each starting division in the regatta.&nbsp; Click on those divisions
that should be part of this fleet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="selectall"></a><b>Select All:</b>&nbsp; Check
here to quickly select all starting divisions to be part of the fleet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="clearall"></a><b>Clear All:</b>&nbsp; Click here
to quickly remove all starting divisions from the fleet.</p>
<p><b><a name="samescore"></a>Score together if same start time:&nbsp; </b>Check
this box if you want starting divisions that start at the same time to be scored
as a single starting class.&nbsp; You would select this if you were scoring a
qualifying regatta where say &quot;green&quot; and &quot;pink&quot; classes were
racing one race together and the starters in those two divisions should be
combined into a single race.</p>
<p><b><a name="handlediff"></a>Handle races with different lengths:&nbsp; </b>Select
how you want races involving starting divisions that sail a different length
race handled.&nbsp; Currently there are two options: drop that race from the
fleet series score, or score them as is and ignore the difference.</p>
