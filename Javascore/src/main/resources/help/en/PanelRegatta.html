<h3>Java Score: Regatta Panel</h3>
<p>Contains parameters about the regatta as a whole.&nbsp; All of the fields are
optional, but I strongly recommend giving the regatta a decent name </p>
<a name="name"></a><b>Name</b>: The name of the regatta.&nbsp; I will create a
default file name for saving the regatta based on this name.
<p><a name="hostclub"></a><b>Club</b>: The name of the Host Club (just a plain text field, no validation)
<p><a name="dates"></a><b>Dates</b>: this is just a plain text field, does not
have to be a valid date
<p><a name="pro"></a><b>PRO</b>: the name of the Principal Race Officer
<p><a name="jurychair"></a>J<b>ury Chair</b> - the name of the chairman of the
protest committee
p><a name="scoring"></a><b>Scoring System</b>  choice box - Allows you to
select the series scoring system to be used.&nbsp; Currently, the ISAF '97-2000
Low Point is supported, and the standard modifications used by the Snipe and
Lightning classes are supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scoring Options</b> button - Bring up a field that
allows you to set the scoring system for the regatta series, and options related
to it.</p>
<p><a name="usebownumbers"></a><b>Use Bow Numbers</b> - this check box tells
whether or not bow numbers are being used for this regatta.
<p><a name="final"></a><b>Results are final</b> -&nbsp; This box should be checked when
the results for a regatta have been finalized.&nbsp; All races are completed,
all protests are resolved.&nbsp; It will immediately save the regatta file,
create an updated set of reports label &quot;final&quot;, and set an internal
flag that will prevent you from editing the regatta in JavaScore when the Final
box is checked.</p>
<p><a name="splitfleet"></a><b>Qualifying/final series</b> - Check this box if the regatta is
going to be scored by splitting the entries into groups for the purposes of running a qualifying 
series followed by a finals series.</p>
<p><a name="dailyscores"></a><b>Generate daily series results</b> - Check this box to have
the series result reports include a mini-series for all races sailed each day of the event
<p><a name="divisions"></a><b>Starting Classes</b> list - This is a list of all
classes that are starting this event and should be scored as individual
classes.&nbsp; No fleets or subfleets are yet supported.&nbsp; The full list of
defined classes can be found under the menu item &quot;Master Files |
Divisions&quot;.&nbsp; This includes handicap systems and the range of ratings
contained within a class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="add"></a><b>Add</b> button - use this to add a new class to the
regatta. This will bring up a choice box containing all the classes that are not
yet a part of this regatta.&nbsp; If you need a new class, go to Master Files |
Divisions to create the class.</p>
<p><a name="remove"></a><b>Remove</b> button - use this to remove a class from
the regatta.&nbsp; Select a class from the &quot;Starting Classes&quot; list
then press the remove button.&nbsp; If there are any boats already entered into
a class that is removed, then their class assignment will be changed to
&quot;&lt;none&gt;&quot;.&nbsp; If left in the regatta, those boats will show up
in the finish dialogs, but will never get assigned any series points.</p>

<p><b><a name="editdiv"></a>Edit</b> button - use this button to edit a division
in an existing regatta.&nbsp; If the change (say a minimum rating change) causes
boats entered in the division to be invalid, you will be notified.&nbsp;
Similarly, if there are boats not in a division that are eligible for the
modified division, you'll have the opportunity to have them automatically placed
in the modified division.</p>
