<h2>Java Score - Import Dialog</h2>

<p>There are now three separate dialogs for importing information: importing
entry information, importing finishes, and importing mark roundings.&nbsp; All
three dialogs work about the same.&nbsp; This file uses the importing entries
screen as an example.</p>
<p>This dialog lets you import regatta entries and finishes from an Excel
spreadsheet.&nbsp; The spreadsheet in Excel show be arranged with each row being
an entry and the columns being the information about the entry (skipper name,
boat name, sail id, finishes if any, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;here are the steps:</p>
<p>(1) In Excel, select the rows you
want to import to JavaScore.&nbsp; &quot;Copy&quot; this block of cells to your
clipboard ( on the menu bar, Edit, Copy): </p>
<p><img border="0" src="importexcel.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="432" height="372"> </p>
<p><a name="paste"></a>(2) Next go to the Import Dialog in JavaScore by selecting the menu item
&quot;File&quot;, &quot;Import Regatta...&quot;.&nbsp; In that dialog click
on the <b> Paste</b> button, and JavaScore will create a table of the data it finds on
the clip board.</p>
<p><a name="table"></a>(3) The screen will show you a left hand column full of
&quot;choice boxes&quot; that lets you tell JavaScore what each
field in the import should become in JavaScore.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next 3
columns are the first 3 rows of your import data set. The following screen shot
shows the pasted cells from Excel, with the first three variable names already
set, and the &quot;Bow&quot; field about to be registered.</p>
<p><a name="ok"></a>(4) Press the <b>OK</b> key, a new Regatta is created at the data from this table
is used to populate the regatta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="importjs.gif" width="387" height="396"></p>

<p>If there are any race results contained in the selected
variable,&nbsp; new races will be create as necessary and populated with
finishes.</p>
<p>The <i> only</i> time Finish Points are saved is when it matches a RDR
or MAN penalty.&nbsp; Otherwise the points will be overwritten when JavaScore
turns around and does its own calculations.</p>

<p>Note also, that if you import FinishPosition, that should be the position not
necessarily the points assigned, and the penalty must be entered via a separate
field.</p>

<p>This is not terribly bullet proof yet.&nbsp; I strongly suggest that you
ALWAYS include the Sail Id and Helmsman Last Name (at least) in the import.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not very graceful yet at handling problems, and I will flag every error
separately, so if you have a problem in the same cell in every row of your
import, you may get the same error for each row.&nbsp; Yes its ugly, but fixing
that is a lower priority than other things right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="exit"></a>(5) If you change your mind and don't want to do the
import, press the <b>Cancel</b> button</p>

<p><b>Side Notes for Techies and other computer savvy users</b>:&nbsp; The
format on the clipboard is a very simple one, the fields are text-based, one row
at a time, the cells in a row are separated by the &quot;Tab&quot; character,
and the rows are separated by the &quot;carriage return&quot;.&nbsp; This is the
&quot;Unformatted Text&quot; format that Excel puts on a clipboard.&nbsp; I have
not checked but this format could probably easily be replicated by a variety of
means.&nbsp; (i.e. you are probably not limited to importing from Excel, any
tab/return based file should be &quot;pastable&quot;)</p>
<p><b>Not Yet Implemented:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>(release 2.1) add some ability to look at import headers from the excel
    import and &quot;guess&quot; at the variable names.</li>
</ul>
