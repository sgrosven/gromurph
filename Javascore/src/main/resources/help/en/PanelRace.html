<h3>Java Score - Race Screen</h3>
<p>This panel edits information about races and finishes in them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The window has two main components.&nbsp; On the left is a &quot;tree&quot; of
all races in the regatta.&nbsp; On the right is the details about the selected
race (if any).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on any race to the left to see its details, or to edit its finishes.</p>
<p>Press Add to add a new race.</p>
<p>Select one or more races, and press Delete.</p>
<p>Current Information about each Race</p>
<p><a name="name"></a><b>Name</b>: name of the race.&nbsp; This will default to a number (e.g., if
fifth race created, then 5).&nbsp; It does not have to be a number, but I
strongly suggest you either use the default number, or at least start the name
with a number unless you have a good reason not to do so.&nbsp; The RRS A1.5
requires races to be number sequentially in order of completion.&nbsp; JavaScore
will sort the races by name, but will look to the first word to see if it is
numeric and sort the first word numerically (so if you have say 12 races, named
'1' through '12', they will sort 1 through 12, not the undesirable order of : 1,
10, 11, 12, 2, 3, ...)</p>
<p><b><a name="startdate"></a>Start Date:</b> The date of the start of the race.&nbsp;
For new races, the date will default to the today.</p>
<p><b>For each starting class</b> in the regatta, you should enter the following
information.&nbsp; You have the option of entering this information for every
starting class registered in the regatta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Include?</b>&nbsp; This box should be checked if the class is participating
in this races (By default, when you create a new race, all classes are presumed
to be racing).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="starttime"></a><b>Start Time</b>&nbsp; Starting time for a class in this
race.&nbsp; This field is optional, but if not included, then no handicap
corrected times will be calculated.</p>
<p><a name="length"></a><b>Length</b> the length of the race.&nbsp; This field
is also optional, but may be needed to properly handicap boats in the race.  </p>
<p><b><a name="nextday"></a>Next Day?</b> Sometimes, you get some classes off for a race, then have to wait until the next day to get the rest of the classes started. Click this box when that happens.</p>
<p><b><a name="lengthPursuit"></a>Original Length</b> Only use this field for a pursuit race that is shortened.  The original planned distance (on which the start times were calculated) in this field.  In the Length field to the left put the actual race distance.</p>

<p><a name="clearalldivs"></a><b>Clear All &quot;Is Racing&quot;</b> button:&nbsp; Clears the &quot;Is racing&quot; check box for all divisions. Right after clicking this, there will be no divisions are participating in this race. Any actual finishes that were previously entered are unaffected until you leave the race dialog and the regatta is rescored.</p>
<p><a name="setalldivs"></a><b>Set All &quot;Is Racing&quot;</b> button:&nbsp; Sets the &quot;Is racing&quot; check box for all divisions. Right after checking this button, all divisions will participate in this race.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="finishes"></a><b>Edit Finishes</b> button:&nbsp; Click here to bring up a dialog to enter and edit
the finishes and penalties for boats in the race.</p>
<p><a name="roundings"></a><b>Edit Roundings</b> button.&nbsp; This is optional
and will allow you to enter the order in which boats rounded a mark of the
course.&nbsp; It is a quick and dirty implementation so far.&nbsp; The mark are
numerically number and you are given a choice list of the mark number for which
you want to enter roundings.&nbsp; Then you will see the same Finishes dialog
but you are entering roundings instead (so don't bother entering penalties
there, they will be ignored).</p>
<p><a name="comments"></a><b>Edit Comments </b>button.&nbsp; This is optional
and will allow you to entry free form comments about the race.&nbsp; These
comments will be inserted at the top of the individual race reports.&nbsp; They
will be formatted in HTML so feel free to include any html tags you wish.</p>
<p><b><a name="advanced"></a>Advanced</b> button.&nbsp; Click here to open a 
window for advanced options for scoring this race, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Overnight/distance race</b>.&nbsp; Check if the race is likely to 
	have finishers after midnight of the first day of racing.&nbsp; It enables 
	entry of extended finishing times in the format&nbsp; D/hh:mm:ss&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	where &quot;D&quot; is the number of days after the start.</li>
	<li><b><a name="pursuitrace" id="pursuitrace"></a>Pursuit Race.</b>&nbsp; Check this box is this race is a PHRF Pursuit race, where the start times for each boat are based on their rating in order to have a boat-for-boat finish. In the main race dialog, you will set the intended length of the race.</li>
	<li><b><a name="pursuitraceshortened" id="pursuitraceshortened"></a>Shortened?.</b>&nbsp; Check this box ONLY if you started a Pursuit race and then shortened it after starting.  In the race info, you will be able to set the actual length of the race in addition to the original intended length.</li>
	<li><b><a name="medalrace" id="medalrace"></a>ISAF Medal Race.</b>&nbsp; Check this box is this race is to be scored as an ISAF Medal Race. If selected, the non-discardable option and a race weight of 2 will automatically be assigned. (Note: this is 
	non-standard and sailing instructions must change RRS Appendix A).</li>
	<li><b><a name="nondiscardable"></a>Race is non-discardable.</b>&nbsp; Click 
	if this race may not be discarded in series scoring.&nbsp; If selected, the 
	race will be counted for all boats in all divisions.&nbsp; (Note: this is 
	non-standard and sailing instructions must change RRS Appendix A).</li>
	<li><b><a name="weight"></a>Race weight:</b> Normally all races count the 
	same for series scoring.&nbsp; Change this value to have this race weighted 
	differently.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each boats score for the race will be multiplied by 
	this value.&nbsp; So to have a race count double, enter &quot;2.0&quot; here.&nbsp; 
	Applies to all scores, all boats, all divisions.</li>
	<li><a name="timeontime"></a><b>Time on Time Factors:</b> These fields are used for PHRF Time-on-Time scoring.&nbsp; The default A- and B-factors can be set in Javascore | Preferences.  In Advance options, you can customize<br>the A- and B-factors for a specific race.  These fields are generally hidden from view unless the regatta
has at least one division being scored in PHRF Time-on-Time. <br><a name="bfactor"></a>For &quot;B-factor, you can either select one of the standard values based on wind
conditions.&nbsp; Or select &quot;Custom&quot; and specify a different B-factor in the &quot;B Factor&quot; field.<br><a name="afactor"></a>Use the A Factor text field to change the default A Factor for a specific race.<br></li>
</ul>
