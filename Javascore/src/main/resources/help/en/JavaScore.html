<H1>JavaScore Help</H1>

Welcome to the JavaScore, a regatta scoring program for sailboat regattas.

<H2>How to use help</H2>
The JavaScore uses the JavaHelp system to provide access to help.  To the left of
this document, you will see a panel with three tabs.  The first tab is
the Table of Contents.  It is loosely organized by the various tools within the
JavaScore.  Click on a topic to see the help for that topic.  The second tab is
the Index.  It will eventually contain a list of indexed keywords that can be quickly
searched for a topic of interest.  The third tab provides the ability to search
the JavaScore documentation for any text and see all matches to that search.

<H2>Context-sensitive help</H2>
The JavaScore includes support for context-sensitive help.  Either click on the help icon on
the toolbar or select "What's This?" from the Help menu.  This will enable the context-sensitive
help cursor.  Then, click once on the area for which you'd like help.  Not all areas of the
JavaScore have context-sensitive help available, so certain items will take you to more specific
help than others.  Also, some items will take you outside the JavaScore documentation to
a technical document on the web that is related to the selected item.  If you are not connected
to the internet, these references will fail.
<P>
Note: pressing the <B>F1</B> key, or the <B>Help</B> key on systems with a <B>Help</B> key, will display
help for the currently selected window.&nbsp;
<P>
The help that has been written is still a bit rough.&nbsp; If you find
&quot;holes&quot; in the help information or have questions that are not
answered, please contact Sandy at <a href="mailto:sandy@gromurph.org">sandy@gromurph.org</a>.&nbsp;
I'd also welcome help writing and improving the help that is available
