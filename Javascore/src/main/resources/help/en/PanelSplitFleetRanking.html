<h3>JavaScore - Split by Ranking</h3>
<p>Use this dialog to split a fleet into new stages and divisions at the end of a stage. The split will be performed based on current overall stage ranking with the top boats going to the first division, the lower boats going into another division (or not advancing at all)</p>
<p>The splits must be specified in the Sailing Instructions. </p>
<p>Note that in this split, new Stages and new Divisions will both be created. Each stage will have one division in it, and the stage name and division names will be the same. The new stages' scoring options will be, by default, the same as their previous stage.</p>
<p>If you create a new split, and later decide you want to delete it. Go into &quot;Divisions | Subdivisions&quot; and delete the divisions.  Go into &quot;Regatta | Stages&quot; and delete stages. If you have scored races involving those divisions, you should also delete those races or their scores will be incorrect.</p>
<p>The panel has the following fields:</p>
<p><a name="srcstage"></a> <strong>Stage to Split:</strong> This is the stage in which the split is to occur. This will also become the &quot;Previous stage&quot; for the new stages.</p>
<p><a name="srcdivision" id="srcdivision"></a> <strong>Division to Split:</strong> This is the division that is to be split into new stages and divisions. </p>
<p><a name="numsplits" id="numsplits"></a> <strong>Number of new divisions:</strong> The number of new stages/divisions to be created.</p>
<p><a name="newdivname" id="numsplits2"></a> <strong>New Stage/Division Names:</strong> The names of each new stage/division. If a division or stage already exists, you will get an alert, and have the option to keep the existing stage/division (with all entries replaced) or cancel out.</p>
<p><a name="topposition" id="numsplits3"></a> <strong>Top Pos:</strong> The ranking for the top boat to be placed into each division. If some boats will not advance into a new stage/division, then place the ranking of the first boat to not advance in the bottom-most row (&quot;Not advancing&quot;)</p>
<p><a name="createcarryover" id="numsplits4"></a> <strong>Create Carryover Race:</strong> If you want the new stage to include a carryover race where each boat's score is their ranking from the preceding stage (relative to other boats in their new stage), then check this box. The carryover race will be created in each new stage, and the stage's scoring options will be set accordingly.</p>
