<p><b>JavaScore</b><b> Main Toolbar and Menu</b></p>
<p><a name="regatta"><b>Regatta</b> Button</a> - Brings up the
regatta panel to allow you edit the overall regatta fields.&nbsp; If no regatta
has been opened, the Open Regatta dialog automatically comes up.</p>
<p><b><a name="entries"></a>Entries</b> Button - Brings up the entries panel to allow you to enter and
edit the boats entered in the regatta (As of release 0.01, all boats must be
one-design and are in the same division)</p>

    for more details.</li>
  <li><b>Restore Regatta</b> - when you open a regatta, or explicitly save it, I create
    an &quot;backup&quot; version called .regatta~ (you may have seen these
    cluttering up your directory.&nbsp; If you ask to Restore, I'll discard the
    current regatta entirely and reload from the backup.</li>
  <li><b>Preferences Panel</b> - Allows you to modify the overall program preferences.
    Click <a href="PanelPreferences.html">here</a> for more details</li>
  <li><b>Exit</b> - exits JavaScore</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of <b>saving regattas</b>, the following scheme is used to keep you
from losing your information:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>when you create a regatta, I give it a temporary file name until you do your first explicit save</li>
    <li>when a regatta is opened or created, a &quot;backup&quot; of the regatta
      with the extensions '.regatta~' is created.&nbsp; The contents of this
      backup are not touched until you either: explicitly save the regatta, or
      you open the regatta again JavaScore .</li>
    <li>Whenever you exit out of the Regatta form, the Entries form, or the
      Races form, I automatically save the regatta (under the .regatta name, the
      backup is left untouched).</li>
    <li>When you explicitly Save the regatta, I delete the old backup version
      and create a new one with the just saved regatta.</li>
    <li>When you open a previously saved regatta, I delete the old backup file
      (if any) and create a new one.</li>
    <li>If you RESTORE the regatta, I dump the current regatta and reload the
      latest &quot;regatta~&quot; regatta.</li>
    <li>Reports are re-generated whenever the regatta is saved, whether JavaScore
      does in automatically, or you explicitly save the regatta, or you go to
      view the regatta's reports.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is probably overkill, but it
      should make it very difficult for the reports to get out of synch with the
      regatta file (unless you have manually renamed a backup 'regatta~'&nbsp;
      but since re-opened the regatta and given JavaScore a chance to update the
      reports)</li>
  </ul>

<p><b><a name="reports"></a>Reports</b> Menu -&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Show Reports</b> - Brings a browser to display reports.&nbsp; The
    program will, by default, try to use the default browser you have set on
    your computer.&nbsp; If this doesn't work, or you want to use something
    different, use the Preferences panel under the&nbsp; File menu to change
    it.&nbsp; Use the browser's capabilities to print reports.</li>
  <li><b>Report Options</b> - Allows you to set the various options that control
    formatting of the reports. For more details, click <a href="PanelReportOptions.html">here</a>.</li>
