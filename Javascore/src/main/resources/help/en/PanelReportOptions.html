<h3>Java Score - Report Options Panel</h3>
<p>Contains report options for formatting of reports. These options are saved
with each regatta, so you can save different options for different events.</p>
<p>The top most choice box lets you select the report for which the options are
being set.</p>
<p><a name="columns"><b>Included Columns</b></a>: This list of items allows you
to specify in which of three columns the specific data item will be included.</p>
<p>The drop down list with decimal numbers indicates the column number on the
left of the decimal, and the order within the column on the right.</p>
<p>The left-most column (0-th column so to speak)&nbsp; will always contain the
Sail id (and bow number if applicable).</p>
<p>Selecting for example, &quot;1.1&quot; for the &quot;Boat&quot; item will
make an entry's Boat name the first part of the first optional column</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;2.1&quot; for Skipper and &quot;2.2&quot; for Crew will cause
the second column to contain &quot;Skipper/Crew&quot;</p>
<p>Select &quot;none&quot; to have the specified data item not included in the
reports at all.</p>
<p>Note that the different between Rating and Full Rtg is for say a PHRF boat
rating 78: its rating will be &quot;78&quot;, its full rating will be
&quot;PHRF/78&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="names"></a>Name Format: </b>Specifies the formatting for Skipper
and Crew Names.</p>
<p>The small table at the bottom of the screen shows an example of how the
column formats will work in the reports.</p>
<p><b><a name="font"></a>Report Body Font: </b>Allows you to set the font style
and font size for the main body of the reports.&nbsp; For some undocumented reason
deep in HTML that I cannot fathom, the template.html formatting described below,
is ignored in the &quot;tables&quot; that make up the main body of almost all of
the reports.&nbsp; So this is your way around it.&nbsp; Default is &quot;<font face="Verdana" size="2">Verdana
10</font>&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you change this font, the sample table cell will update
to give you a feeling for what the font looks like.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest restraint in setting this font.&nbsp; The list of
fonts are those that are available on your current computer.&nbsp; These may not
translate to a different font set when someone else access the report on a
different computer through the internet.</p>
<p><b>Include times for one-design classes? </b>(applicable to Single Race
report only) Determines whether or not a column for finish time will be included
in the Single Race report.&nbsp; If you have an all one-design regatta and are
not tracking finish times, you may want to uncheck this and save some space in
the report.</p>
<p><b>Include only latest &lt;x&gt; races.</b>&nbsp; By clicking this box and
specifying a number of races, only part of a series will be included in the
series report.&nbsp; (Note that the series total points will still reflect the
entire regatta)</p>
<p><b>Do not include points for penalties.</b>&nbsp; When this box is NOT
checked, a penalty will be shown as both the penalty name and the points scored
(say 55/DNC for a DNC that is worth 55 points).&nbsp; If the box IS checked,
then just the penalty abbreviation will be included (just DNC).&nbsp; This can
save space in longer regattas.</p>
<p><b>&quot;Template&quot; file for controlling overall report formatting:</b></p>
<p>You can select and set a template file. If not, JavaScore will look for the &quot;master&quot; 
  html file called 'template.html'.&nbsp; It looks for the file in the main javascore directory. If 
  this file is found, JavaScore will parse the file and use it as a &quot;wrapper&quot; for all the 
  report files.&nbsp; It will look for 3 keywords and will replace them as follows:</p>
<p>'##REGATTA##' will be substituted with the Regatta's name<br>
'##REPORT##' will be substituted with the descriptive name of the relevant
report<br>
'##BODY##' will be substituted with the body of each report</p>
<p>The body of the report will contain the standard header/footer information.
And the core of the report. It will NOT contain any 'font' or otherwise try to
amend typical customized report traits.</p>
<p>The regatta name and report title key can be embedded as many times as the author of the template 
  file wishes. Only one occurrence of the report body key is expected, subsequent occurrences will 
  be ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp; If no occurrence of the ##BODY## key is found. The report body will be placed 
  immediately before the &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&quot; tag.</p>
<p>The template file contains CSS-textformatting templates in the 'head' section. Those who know what 
  they have to do, can use these style templates. They have to replace the 'body' tag parameter 'class=normal' 
  with 'class=modern' or one of the other.</p>
<p><b>Insert a club-logo graphic: </b></p>
<p>Some clubs want to have a club or class logo on top of the reports; the template file is prepared 
  for that. How to:</p>
<p>Make a graphic and save the file with the name <em><strong>'club-logo.jpg'</strong></em> in the 
  JavaScore main directory. You must overwrite the still existing 'club-logo.jpg' sample. The file 
  should have a width and height not greater than 175x80 pixels. Greater graphics were also shown, 
  but they move the '##REPORT##' and '##BODY##' part down. Don't forget to have a very small file 
  size for a quick report display (max. 20Kb recommended).</p>
