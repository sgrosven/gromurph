<p>Release 3.0 of JavaScore adds the ability to score boats in
&quot;fleets&quot; and &quot;subdivisions&quot;.&nbsp; This will be easier to
understand with some background terminology.&nbsp; A boat can be scored in a
variety of ways: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Several individual PHRF classes could be combined into an overall PHRF
    fleet.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A large one-design regatta could be split into several &quot;qualifying
    groups&quot; which race in various combinations.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>A large regatta may include sub-groups for say, Juniors, or Masters, or
    Women</li>
</ul>
<p>JavaScore's method of implementing fleets and subdivisions tries to take all
of the different grouping into account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are three types of groupings for boats:</p>
<p><i><b>Starting Division</b></i>:&nbsp; this is the fundamental group that in
which a boat races.&nbsp; Its starts and finishes are recorded by the race
committee in this context.&nbsp; When defining a single race, only starting
divisions can be given a start.&nbsp; The finish dialog of a single race shows
all the entrants in all the starting divisions that are flagged as participating
in that race.</p>
<p><b><i>Fleet</i></b>: A fleet is a combination of several Starting
Divisions.&nbsp; All members of each Starting Division in a Fleet are combined
into the fleet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Defining a fleet consists of specifying which
starting divisions make up the fleet, and two options:&nbsp; (a) how to handle
races where different starting divisions have different lengths races; (b) how
to handle a race where two starting divisions in the fleet start at the same
time (sharing a starting line).</p>
<p><i><b>Sub-Division:</b></i> Within a Starting Division or Fleet, some boats
may also be flagged as being part of a Sub-Division.&nbsp; They will be scored
as part of that Sub-Division.&nbsp; All sub-divisions have a single parent that
must be either a starting division or a fleet.&nbsp; Options in defining a
sub-division include: (a) if a single boat can be part of more than one
sub-division, and (b) if boats are &quot;re-scored&quot; within their
subdivision as if other members of their parent group didn't exist (i.e if you
were in the Youth sub-division of the Laser starting division, and in race 1 you
finished 5th overall in the Laser but were the first Youth finisher - the scorer
can specify whether that boat's score in the Youth subdivision should be 5
points or 1 point.</p>
<p>Samples of how to setup the typical fleet/subdivision groupings:</p>
<p><b><i>PHRF Overall as a combination of PHRF A, B, C divisions:</i></b> The
regatta should have 3 Starting Divisons: PHRF A, PHRF B, and PHRF C.&nbsp; It
will also have 1 Fleet, &quot;PHRF Overall&quot; that includes these three
starting divisions.&nbsp; Boats would be entered in either PHRF A, B, or
C.&nbsp; They will start and finish in those groups. </p>
<p><i><b>Laser championship with groups for Youth, Women, and Masters:</b></i>&nbsp;
This type of regatta would have a single Starting Division, Laser, and three
Sub-Divisions:&nbsp; Youth, Women, and Masters.&nbsp; For each of the
SubDivisions, the parent would be the Laser, and for each, boats could be
entered in more than one ( a teenage girl would be eligible for both Youth and
Women).&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not a complete self-enforcing system, in a sample
such as this, JavaScore would not be able to enforce the likely rule that the
Youth and Master subdivisions should not have any &quot;joint&quot; members.</p>
<p><i><b>Optimist regatta with all sailors being in one of Blue, White, and
Green (all are racing together in one start):</b></i> The best way to set this
up would be three Starting Divisions, Opti Blue, Opti White, and Opti
Green.&nbsp; Each sailor is entered in one of these starting divisions.&nbsp;
There would also be one Fleet, Optimist, containing each of the three starting
divisions.&nbsp; In the Fleet definition, the flag for scoring boats that
starting together as a single group should be turned on.&nbsp; So if the 3rd
place boat is the first Opti Blue sailor, they will be scored 3rd place, not
&quot;1st&quot; place.&nbsp;&nbsp; In each race, include all three starting
divisions, and give them the same starting time.</p>
<p><i><b>The &quot;typical&quot; Qualification Series.</b></i> A large fleet is
split into 4 groups, for example, Pink, Yellow, Green, and Blue.&nbsp; Each race
in the series has two starts with two of the groups starting in each
start.&nbsp; So in race 1, in the first start, Pink and Yellow race together
(and are scored as a single group), in the 2nd start, Green and Blue start (and
are scored) together.&nbsp; In Race 2, Pink and Green are in the first start,
and Yellow and Blue are in the second start.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create 4 starting divisions (Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue) and
one Fleet &quot;Overall&quot;.&nbsp; Set the flag that boats starting together
are scored together. In the first Race, give Pink and Yellow the same starting
time, then give Yellow and Blue a second starting time.</p>
