<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="rsa" id="rsa"></a><strong>Misc1 Label:</strong> 
  Optional field label in the entries panel. After the first installation you'll find &quot;CBYRA#&quot; 
  or &quot;Rsa&quot; or something similar. This is only a default, which is shipped with Javascore.

  </strong> Another optional field label in the entries panel. After the first installation you'll 
  find &quot;US Sailing#&quot; oder &quot;Mna&quot; or something similar. This is only a default,
