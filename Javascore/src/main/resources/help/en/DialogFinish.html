<h2>Java Score - Finish Dialog</h2>
<p>This panel finishes boats or record mark roundings.&nbsp; It has 3 main parts.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a name="finished"></a><b>Finish Table</b>:&nbsp; In the top left is a table that is analogous to most race committee's finish
sheets.&nbsp; You can enter a sail number in the sail column, a finish time in
the finish column, and/or click on the penalty field to enter penalty
information.</p>
<p>When you enter a time, you should use one of the following formats:&nbsp; 'hh:mm:ss',&nbsp;
'hhmmss', 'mmss', 'ss'.&nbsp; When you omit hours or minutes, I'll automatically
insert the last use hours and/or minutes.</p>
<p><a name="unfinished"></a><b>Unfinished Table:</b> In the bottom right is a list of unfinished boats.&nbsp; Double clicking on
any boat in this list will add that boat as the last finisher.</p>
<p><a name="finish"></a><b>Current Entry/Finish</b>: In the top right is a display-only panel showing the details of whatever
boat/finish you last highlighted.&nbsp; This could be a row in the finish table,
or an entry in the unfinish list</p>
<p><a name="insert"></a><b>Insert Button</b>: Inserts a new finish slot at the row selected in the
table.&nbsp; First click on the row where you want the new finish placed.&nbsp;
Press Insert, the current finish in that row and all subsequent finishes will be
moved down one row and an empty finish created for you to enter a sail number.&nbsp;
Note that if all boats are registered as finishers, you cannot insert... to MOVE
a boat, first delete its old finish, then insert its new finish</p>
<p><b><a name="delete"></a>Delete Button:</b> Deletes a finisher, return the boat to the unfinished
list.&nbsp; Click on the finisher you wish to delete.&nbsp; Press Delete&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="remaining"></a>Add Remaining button:&nbsp;</b> Provides a means for creating finishes for all
remaining unfinished boats.&nbsp; These finishes must have some
&quot;non-finish&quot; penalty associated with them.&nbsp; Click on the Add
Remaining button, and you will be given a dialog with a button for each of the
non-finish penalties.&nbsp; Click on the desired penalty, and all of those boats
will be moved to the finish table with that penalty assigned to them.&nbsp;
(NOTE: that you will be unable to score a race if there are boats that should
have sailing that race that are not registered in the finish table.</p>
