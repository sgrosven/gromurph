<h3>JavaScore - Penalty Panel</h3>
</font>

<p>This panel lets you enter penalty information for an entry in a race.</p>
<p>I've grouped penalties into the following groups.&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><a name="nonfinish"></a>Non-Finish penalties:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; A boat can only have 1 of these
penalties.&nbsp; If assigned one, the boat does not rank as a finisher for any
penalties in a scoring system that might care how many boats finish.</p>
<p><b><a name="dsq"></a>Disqualification </b><b>Penalties</b>.&nbsp; This is a bit of a misnomer, it include
boats that have not technically been disqualified, but the effect is analogous.&nbsp;
These are penalties that will override a boats finish position completely.&nbsp;
If the boat is assigned one of these penalties, then boats finishing after them
will have the finishes adjusted upwards. &nbsp;
A boat can only be assigned one of these penalties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="percentStandard"></a>Standard Percentage Penalties:</b> These are the percentage scoring penalties.
 These are percentage penaltyies are calculated as per RRS 44.  It's uncommon
but boats can be assigned more that one of these penalties, in
combination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several do not make sense to assign in
combination.&nbsp; It is the scoring system's job to make sense of it.&nbsp;
Quickly here's a summary of what these penalties mean:</p>
<blockquote>
    <li>1st, 2nd, 3rd Z-Flag - boat received one or more penalties under RRS 30.2. </li>
    <li>Check-in failure - boat is assigned a penalty for failing to check-in
      properly. NOTE: this is beyond the RRS, and the SI's for the regatta must
      provide for this penalty.&nbsp; The amount of the penalty is a percentage
      and is defined under the <a href="PanelScoringLowPoint.html">Advanced Scoring
      Options</a> panel within the main regatta parameters</li>
      <li>After Race Penalty - this is an  scoring penalty generally affiliated with
      Arbitration.  It is basically a 40% penalty with an adjustable "cap" to be either 40% or half the 
      distance between a 20% penalty and a DNF.  it requires SI language to implement.
      See ussailing.org/judges/arbitration for more details on the after race penalty. 
      See Advanced Scoring Options to change the base 40% to something else.</li>
   </ul>
 </blockquote>  
 <p><b><a name="percentCustom"></a><a name="percent"></a>Custom  Percentage Penalties:</b> 
 These are two customize percentage  penalties.  Check the appropriate box for a 
 scoring percentage or a elapsed time percentage.  Then use the text field to enter
 the percentage amount.
</p>

 
 <p><b><a name="panelRedress"></a>Redress/Manual:</b> 
 These are the scoring modifications that often come out of redress hearings.
 Also just scoring unusual happenings.   You can choose from among several
 types/amounts of adjustments.  And you can customize the label that shows on
 the score sheets (Label).   The options include:
</p>
<blockquote>

<ul>     
    <li>None: the default.</li>
    <li>Avg All Races: boat will receive a score equal to the average of other
      finishes in accordance with RRS A10(a) (2013 Rules).&nbsp; NOTE: check with the protest
      committee when they award this penalty as they may say average points but
      not know about the A10(a) definition.&nbsp; If the jury intends something
      other than A4(a), you'll have to manually enter the points via
      &quot;Points&quot; option.</li>
    <li><a name="points"></a>Points: if a boat gets some oddball points that the
      scoring program doesn't deal with so the scorer must enter this manually.
      Select the Points button, then enter the score the boat should receive in 
      the text box.  I recommend that you use the Note
      field to explain to the competitors.</li>
    <li><a name="timepenalties"></a>Elapsed/Corrected Time.   JavaScore now 
    supports two time-based penalties:&nbsp; one applied to a boat's elapsed time,
    the other to its corrected time.  Use the text field to enter the raw amount 
    of time to be added.  (Use a minus sign to reduce a boat's time).</li>
 </ul>
      
<p>NOTE: for both Manual and Redress, if the boat ranks as a finisher, it
      should have a valid finish position, and boats finishing below it will <i>not</i>
      generally have their positions moved up.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the boat did not
      finish, it should have one of the non-finishing penalties assigned to it, <i>in
      addition</i> to the MAN or RDG penalty.</p>
      
<p><a name="labelOther">Label</a>:  Here you can check "RDG" to have a simple RDG label shown on the scoring
reports.  Or select "Other" and use the text box to enter whatever wacky abbreviation you (or the
protest committee) want to be shown on the reports.  Use the Notes field below to explain the abbreviation
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="note"></a><b>Note field</b>: Enter any notes that apply to this penalty here.&nbsp; They will 
  be printed as footnotes on the scoring reports.&nbsp; You might use this field to explain an unusual penalty 
  score, or reference a Hearing number for a DSQ or RDG.&nbsp; </p>
